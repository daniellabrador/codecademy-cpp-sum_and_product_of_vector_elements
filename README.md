# **Sum and Product of Vector Elements**

The Sum and Product of Vector Elements program demmonstrates a simple solution of looping through vector elements. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in learning to declare vectors using C++.

## Project Prompt

Write a program to find the sum of even numbers and the product of odd numbers in a vector.

For example:

Suppose we have a vector that is `{2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9}`.

Then the program should output:

```git
Sum of even numbers is 12
Product of odd numbers is 27
```

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `sumproduct.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

### Command Line / Bash

```git
g++ sumproduct.cpp -o sumproduct
./sumproduct
```

### Command Prompt

```git
g++ sumproduct.cpp -o sumproduct
sumproduct.exe
```

## Sources

The techniques utilized was based on the lessons taught in [Codecademy's Learn C++ Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus
). The challenge is also provided by Codecademy.
